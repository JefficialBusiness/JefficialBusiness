# Who I Am & What I Do

Hello, I’m Jeff/Jeffrey W.

I am an aspiring programmer who is studying at American University in Washington, D.C., hoping to become a freelance programmer and/or securing lucrative job positions (I mean this in the sense that I am able to continue to learn while being paid) that entail the development of software in particular.

# What Languages I Know

To date, I am quite proficient in Python overall, and am actively learning Java and R. My intention is to build on my repertoire as time progresses, so that I am well versed with a wide variety of languages, such as C#, C++, Rust, Lua, etc.

# Technology Preferences & Knowledge

Currently, I am simultaneously a heavy user of Apple macOS (latest release is Monterrey 12.3 as of updating this) and Microsoft Windows 11. I am running macOS on a 2020 model Apple MacBook Pro (ARM-based M1 processor, 512GB storage, 16GB RAM), and Windows 11 on a custom-built tower (Intel Core i9-9900K, 16GB DDR4-3200 RAM, NVIDIA GTX 1650 SUPER 4GB graphics, and 1TB SSD/4TB HDD storage). I am satisfied with such a setup; I currently find no issues or inconveniences in either operating system, with respect to development and general use. 

On occassion, I will utilize Linux, particularly Manjaro and Ubuntu (and Arch on even rarer occasions when I am able to accomplish a successful installation) on older machines in my possession. As a result, I have intermediate knowledge with navigating various Linux operating systems and desktop environments, such as KDE, XCFE, Plasma, and GNOME.

# Experience

On an on/off basis through the 2010s, I experimented with several projects in RobloxStudio, which often entailed the Lua language. Such activites typically involved modification of and various explorative measures using code already written for projects available for public use. My skills with Lua are elementary.

Through late 2018 and early 2019, I was heavily involved in my high school's Robotics Club, where my position was that of the Lead Coder. Under tense time constraints, often in the midst of actual tournaments, I would write and modify code written in the language RobotC in the interest of permitting our desgined robot to perform the tasks required. This typically yielded successful outcomes.

In 2020, I received a score of 4 on my AP Computer Science Principles project/portfolio.
