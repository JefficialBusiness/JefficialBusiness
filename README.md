- Hello, I’m Jeff/Jeffrey
- I am an aspiring programmer who is studying at American University, hoping to become a freelance programmer and securing lucrative job positions that entail the development of software in particular.
- To date, I am quite proficient in Python coding overall, and am actively learning Java and R. My intention is to build on my repertoire as time progresses, so that I am well versed with a wide variety of languages, such as C#, C++, Rust, Lua, etc.
