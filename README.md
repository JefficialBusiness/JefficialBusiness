- Hello, I’m Jeff
- I am an aspiring programmer who is studying at American University, hoping to become a freelance programmer and securing lucrative job positions that entail the development of software in particular.
- I am most knowledgeable in Python, however I hope to learn more languages, such as JavaScript, C++. My skills are fairly rudimentary at the moment, and I am actively working on improving.
