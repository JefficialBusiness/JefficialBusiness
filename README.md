# Who I Am & What I Do

Hello, I’m Jeff/Jeffrey W.

I am an aspiring programmer who is studying at American University (AU) in Washington, D.C.

My objective is to become a full-time freelance programmer and/or secure lucrative job positions (I mean this in the sense that I am able to continue to learn alongside being paid) that entail work that particularly involves code, including software development, analysis of data, and machine learning.

# What Languages I Know

To date, I am quite proficient in Python overall, and am actively learning Java and R. My intention is to build on my repertoire as time progresses, so that I am well versed with a wide variety of languages, such as C#, C++, Rust, Lua, etc.

# Technology Preferences & Knowledge

Currently, I am simultaneously a heavy user of Apple macOS (latest release is Monterrey 12.3 as of updating this) and Microsoft Windows 11. I am running macOS on a 2020 model Apple MacBook Pro ("Apple M1" ARM-based custom SoC, 512GB storage, 16GB RAM), and Windows 11 on a custom-built tower (Intel Core i9-9900K, 16GB DDR4-3200 RAM, NVIDIA GTX 1650 SUPER 4GB graphics, and 1TB SSD/4TB HDD storage). I am satisfied with such a setup; I currently find no issues or inconveniences in either operating system, with respect to development and general use. 

On occassion, I will utilize Linux, particularly Manjaro and Ubuntu (and Arch on even rarer occasions when I am able to accomplish a successful installation) on older machines in my possession. As a result, I have intermediate knowledge with navigating various Linux operating systems and desktop environments, such as KDE, XCFE, Plasma, and GNOME.

# Experience
On an on/off basis through the 2010s, I experimented with several projects in RobloxStudio, which often entailed the Lua language. Such activites typically involved modification of and various explorative measures using code already written for projects available for public use. Due to limited immersion, my skills with Lua are elementary.

Through late 2018 and early 2019, I was heavily involved in my high school's Robotics Club, where my position was that of Lead Coder. Under tense time constraints, often in the midst of actual tournaments, I would write and modify code written in the language RobotC in the interest of permitting our desgined robot to perform the tasks required. This typically yielded successful outcomes.

# Relevant Education
### 2019-2020
In my senior year of high school, I took AP Computer Science Principles with a concentration on the Python language, which would mark my first experiences with such a language and immersive coding in general. In 2020, I received a score of 4 on my AP Computer Science Principles project/portfolio.

### 2021
In the fall semester of my sophomore year of college at AU, I took the following courses:
- CSC-148: Intro to Computer Science I
  - Concentration in Python language
  - Final Grade: A
  - [Link to Portfolio/Archive Repository](https://github.com/JefficialBusiness/CSC148_Archives_Fall21)

### 2022
In the spring semester of my sophomore year of college at AU, I took the following courses:
- CSC-208: Intro to Computer Science II
  - Concentration in Java language
  - Final Grade: A-
