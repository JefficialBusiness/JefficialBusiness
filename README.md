# Who I am & What I Do

Hello, I’m Jeff/Jeffrey W.

I am an aspiring programmer who is studying at American University, hoping to become a freelance programmer and securing lucrative job positions that entail the development of software in particular.

# What Languages I Know

To date, I am quite proficient in Python coding overall, and am actively learning Java and R. My intention is to build on my repertoire as time progresses, so that I am well versed with a wide variety of languages, such as C#, C++, Rust, Lua, etc.

# Technology Preferences

Currently, I am a heavy user of macOS (latest release is Monterrey 12.3 as of updating this) and Microsoft Windows 11. I currently find no issues or inconveniences in either operating system, and so I am not considering any migrations. From time to time, I will utilize Manjaro and Ubuntu (and Arch on even rarer occasions when I am able to accomplish a successful installation) on older machines in my possession.
